<p><b><h3>The college was established in 1956, for providing higher education to local students. Habra Siksha Parishad took initiative with the help of the then Chief Minister, late Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy for the purpose. This project was given a proper shape by the Minister in the D.r Roy's Cabinet, Mr. Tarun Kanti Ghosh, who was also an MLA from Habra. The College began its journey in the premises of Habra High School. thereafter shifted to site of Bangiya Christian Council and finally to its present premises on 5 October 1958. Presently the Sree Chaitanya College is situated in more than 20 acres of land beside the Jessore Road which is about 46 km from Kolkata.[2] Kalyan Niyogi stood 3rd in Pre-University Examination in 1961.
